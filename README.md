# RIP-8

My implementation of a Chip-8 interpreter written in Rust with an egui interface for debugging and rendering.

To run it, you can use cargo run like: `cargo run roms/<rom>` or you can `cargo build --release` to get a full binary and run it like `./target/release/rip-8 roms/<rom>`.

It's only tested to work on Linux systems but I'm working on a Windows implementation if any changes are needed, I have no Mac to test a mac version but feel free to open up an issue if you try using this (for whatever reason) and it doesn't work.

Thank you for taking a look at the first of hopefully many projects of mine in this space.
